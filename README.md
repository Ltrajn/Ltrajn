Hello there! I'm Landen. 
I'm a third year student at NYU and I'm interested in finding efficient solutions to energy problems across the country.
I'm currently learning Java and how to use algorithms to maximize the efficiency of my code. 
You can reach me at landen.messner321@gmail.com
I'm currently working on making a Sudoku game the most efficient way possible. If you are interested in collaborating please contact me!
